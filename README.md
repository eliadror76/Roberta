RoBERTa README
Overview

This repository contains code for utilizing the RoBERTa model for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. RoBERTa, based on the BERT architecture, is a robustly optimized method for pretraining natural language understanding systems.
Requirements

    Python 3
    PyTorch
    Transformers library

Install dependencies using:

bash

pip install torch transformers

Usage

    Download Pretrained RoBERTa Model:
        You can download pre-trained RoBERTa models from the Hugging Face model hub.
        Ensure to select the appropriate model based on your task and requirements.

    Fine-tuning RoBERTa for your task:
        Fine-tuning RoBERTa involves training it on your specific dataset for your NLP task.
        Modify the train.py script to load your dataset, define your model architecture, and set training hyperparameters.
        Run the train.py script to start fine-tuning. Make sure to adjust the paths and configurations accordingly.

    Inference:
        Once you've fine-tuned the model, you can use it for inference on new data.
        Modify the inference.py script to load your trained model and perform inference on your input data.
        Run the inference.py script to generate predictions.

    Evaluation:
        Evaluate the performance of your fine-tuned model using evaluation metrics appropriate for your task.
        Modify the evaluate.py script to load your trained model and evaluate its performance on a validation or test dataset.
        Run the evaluate.py script to assess model performance.

Examples

    Sentiment Analysis: Fine-tune RoBERTa on sentiment analysis datasets such as SST-2 or IMDB.
    Named Entity Recognition (NER): Fine-tune RoBERTa on datasets like CoNLL-2003 for NER tasks.
    Question Answering: Fine-tune RoBERTa on SQuAD for question answering tasks.
